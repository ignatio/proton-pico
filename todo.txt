    What does the pack do?
    The pack functions in the following way (final state):
        - Upon power on, a boot sequence is played. This involves playing a boot up sound and 
        displaying animations on the neopixels for the powercell and cyclotron. During this 
        sequence the wand and all associated controls and effects are locked out completley 
        (whether it is in the activated state or not).
        - After the boot sequence, the pack goes to idle mode. In idle mode there are animations
        playing on the cyclotron and powercell neopixels, and an idle sound is playing.
        - The wand is powered on seperately by switching three toggle switches on the wand. 
        Switch 1 plays a wand boot up sound and starts the boot sequence animation on the oled,
        transitioning to the idle animation once complete. Switch 2 turns on the internal 
        glowing and external blinking wand lights. Switch 3 plays another, different boot sound 
        (indicating saftey off). The activate (fire) button on the wand plays a lockout sound 
        unless these conditions are met, in which case pressing the button activates the 
        firing sequence for the entire pack.
        - The firing sequence involves first playing a firing sound while the activate button 
        is held down. While this sound is playing, the animations on the powercell and cyclotron
        continue as in the idle state. The oled switches from displaying the Idle animation 
        (sweepeing rectangle) to the firing animation (counting bargraph). The wand emiiter 
        lights turn on and display their firing animation.
            - After holding the activate button down for approximately 20 seconds the state of 
            the entire pack changes to the overheat warning mode. If the activate button 
            continues to be held in this mode a different sound is played (firing sound with 
            overheat alarm) and the powercell, cyclotron and wand emitter neopixels change to 
            their overheat animations (more intense, faster). The oled plays its overheat 
            animation (flashing: WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!). The internal wand glow changes
            colour and the external blinking lights flash faster.
                - If the activate button is released in this mode, all animations are reset to 
                their idle states, internal wand lights go back to idle colour and the long wand 
                shutdown sound is played.
                - If the button is held until the end of the overheat warning timer, the pack 
                goes into auto shutdown (venting) mode.
                    - In venting mode, the activate button is locked out. The cyclotron and 
                    powercell lights flash on and off while the venting sound plays. The oled 
                    shows "Venting...". The N-Filter lights turn on and if I decide to add it the
                    smoke effect turns on, venting smoke out hte n-filter. Once this secuence is 
                    completed the pack resets completely and activates the Boot secquence. 
        - If the activate button is released during normal firing (before overheat) the short wand
        shutdown sound plays and the oled returns to its idle animation.

    Add DFMANAGER
        Needs to:
            - Play a track sent as an argument 
                -(DFPLAYERMINI already does this by exposing Player.play())
            - Raise an event when a sound is completed (for handling transitions between states)
                - Knowing when the song is done playing can be accompished either by reading 
                the busy pin or by keeping track of the length of each file and async awaiting
                for the file to be completed.
                    - if using file lengths need to provide a table of track numbers and lengths
                    and send both of these attributes to the function that calls Player.play()
                - Need to have a way to handle transitions, like play this, then that. 
                    -should this be in a seperate class that handles a state machine for the 
                    entire pack or part of a seperate music manager class?
